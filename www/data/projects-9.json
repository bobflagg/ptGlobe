The goal of the research is to isolate those elements that comprise visual motion, such as position, direction, speed, and time, in order to develop a visual language through which the social complexities of online communities can be communicated. A series of studies exploring this problem are being carried out using a theoretical framework inspired by cognitive and artistic precedents.

In this system a webcam is used to track the objects and a computer vision algorithm is used to control the devices based on the webcam input.It can be stretched to any of our daily applications,such as Television,Gaming..etc The traditional user interfaces relies much on the mouse and keyboard. But it is difficult to use these devices continuously. The aim is to develop a gesture based interface, where the system uses inbuilt webcam to track the hand movement and controls the mouse pointer accordingly. The first step towards this is the development of object tracking mechanism. Though there several object tracking algorithms are readily available, CAMSHIFT algorithm provides more accuracy when compared to MEAN SHIFT and others. The other option is the use of HAAR classifiers but involves a tedious process of training and also we cannot extend it to different objects. So we modified the OpenCv CAMSHIFT algorithm to track our objects. The Second Step is to distinguish the object color from our skin color, so we added a red ribbon to the hands such it not only provides a clear view but also gives an option for different gestures. Finally the algorithm tracks the hand using the input from the webcam and the co-ordinates are extracted from the tracked object for every frame and passed to windows m functions. Thus whenever the object is moved via webcam, the cursor also moves accordingly. Different gestures are used to produce click functions and other operations.",

        "content": "Swerve / Crab Drive Steering Mechanism. A steering system which allows for the most flexible configurations of wheels and movements. It allows each wheel to be independently controlled both in power and direction (a full 360 degrees). This configuration and control mechanism allows for virtually any possible movement which can be made by a wheeled vehicle. While more complicated compared to most other control mechanisms it is the least restrictive and could be employed in specialized robots where operational requirements change. Many of the standard wheeled drive configurations that are used in vehicles and robotics are chosen because of their simplicity to build, control, and suitability to a specific task (kinds of mobility / maneuverability required). This generally works well except each of these common configurations typically exclude maneuvers that another form might have, thus having the designers to make a limiting choice (what can they live without). This was the motivating thought, can we design a steering system that is reasonably reliably, cost effective, replaceable, and most important uncompromising in functionality. Essential this would be an extension of synchronous steering, with the main difference being that in a synchronous configuration all wheels are able to rotate orientation to 90 degrees as long as all the wheels are rotated to the same angle. In our configuration we stipulate that each wheel can rotate its orientation a full 360 degrees and drive power independently of one another. Review of many different drive mechanisms to see what each specifically offered, how they were different, the complexity in building the mechanism, the electronic control of the mechanics, and how to interface with the controls. We looked at differential, skid, ackermann, synchronous, omni, articulated, and independent. <p>The list of parts included in this design is: <br /> <ul> <li>Drive Motors: CIMS - 1 per wheel - there are (4) wheels</li> <li>Wheels: 4 in AndyMark Plaction wheels (am-0198)</li> <li>Gear Reduction: 8.30:1 in 2 stages (56:18 by HTD5 synchronous belt & pulleys; 24:9 by #35 chain & sprockets)</li> <li>Steering Motors: BaneBots M3-RS395-12 - 1 per wheel</li> <li>Steering Reduction: BaneBots 3-stage 132:1 planetary gearbox; transmitted 1:1 via HTD5 synchronous belt with 32T pulleys</li> </ul> </p> This design was further modified to make it more cost effective to implement this in an actual robot, and make each wheel component self contained within a cube that can be easily swapped out when problems arose. We also learned that in the actual implementation the sway / lateral movement of the wheel mechanism when under stress was not stable so we needed a way to stabilize the lateral movement. The implementation proved to be a very cost effective and agile first iteration of the concept. More improvements can be made on how the lateral force of the drive mechanism is handled and replacing nylon buffers with bearings for a stronger and smoother operation. This configuration was able to replicate all the common modes of operation while allowing non-standard ways of movement. We decided to go with three wheels instead of 4 to save on weight in the overall design. However controlling this type of locomotion is not trivial, both in the logic implementation and physical control. Better input devices are required besides the dual joystick configuration we used. Encoders were used to track the wheel position as well as speed of rotation paired with a 2-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. These sensors were needed to auto correct for drift and orientation since forward is the way the wheels are pointed (NOT the front of the robot). This notion means the controls translate in real-time relative to the direction of travel, and it was this configuration operators were able to most easily able to control the robot.",

        "content": "Multi-agent Simulation for Task Selection on Collaborating Communities. Analysis of a multi-agent system intended to model total task completion rates in collaborating communities. The spillover effect is emergent. We begin to quantify externality of marginal utilities. We are concerned with maximizing the output of the given community through regulation of agent to task ratios. We outline emergent externalities when collaboration occurs, even in absence of communication and planning. Our recent work has shown that as the collaboration among agents increases, the performance of the agent community increases linearly and the optimal performance of the agent community is achieved when the collaboration among agents is 100%. Furthermore, when the number of tasks assigned is far fewer than the number of agents in the community, the optimal performance of the agent community is achieved at nearly 100% collaboration rate. We have developed a series of multiagent simulations for a domain neutral environment where agents performed abstract tasks. The task selection process has three variants based on how the agents collaborate; min-collaboration, random-collaboration, maxcollaboration. The min-collaboration and maxcollaboration are greedy algorithms because the try to maximize or minimize distribution of agents among tasks respectively. Often situations arrise where communities exist and individuales have to \"cooperate\" in order to complete taks, however in some of these situations there might not be a centralized command to direct people or a means of identifying which individuals are more suited to specific tasks better than others. This raises the question of how to form collaboration groups in this environment which will be reasonable effective and have the minimization of wasting resources, or maximizing community output. It is apparent that given the marginal utility that agents on the upper ends of collaboration levels would achieve a better perform- ance for the community as a whole if they were re- distributed to other tasks. This illustrates that the major controlling attribute is ultimately the distribu- tion of agents among the tasks or in this case the task selection algorithm. The safe task selection al- gorithm out of the three that were tried was the ran- dom-collaboration-task-selection. Meaning that if you have no means of regulating collaboration ran- dom always produces more output than no cooperation. However, if you have mechanisms for regulat- ing groups, even as simply as regulating the percentage out of the community involved. Then it is best to maximize the group to around 70% collaboration levels to maximize the output of the community (Figure 5). <br /><br /> It is also apparent that by regulating how the tasks are selected you can control the externalities in the system, if this is a concern to you or if you need to evaluate the benefit to the sys- tem as a whole. You also cannot just simply look at output when determining efficiency of a community when collaboration occurs, because as shown much waste and spillover can occur when there is interdependence among agents.",

The output is produced in a generalized form that can then be \u201crendered\u2014 into different modalities, such as WAP (cell phone output), audio, or a regular computer screen. The Context Manger can also \u201cpush\u2014 highly relevant information to the user, consolidating the point-of-contact between a multitude of services and the user in a consistent, manageable way. This infrastructure will be part of several projects, including ReachMedia, Invisible Media, and the UbER-Badge Personalization Project.",

The amount of information available in current literature and even the mass of information being generated on a daily basis is well beyond the scope of human understanding in any detail. Because of the sheer breadth of information, human analysis and curation of this information is rarely comprehensive and often error-prone. Machine-aided curation of this information could increase its utility by allowing more comprehensive analyses, more complete summarization, and extensive comparisons to current knowledge. Such curation requires a method for arriving at a high-level semantic description of the text at hand. Patent Semantics is an attempt to attack this problem in the domain of biochemical synthesis, by building structured representations of the procedures involved in different synthesis descriptions, grounding the components of those models, and developing algorithms by which detailed, human-readable comparisons of the descriptions may be produced.",

As a result, this system understands relatively complex expressions referring to a scene of objects and can indicate the object being described.

It keeps track of arm movement and uses models of arm motion to create entertaining and useful feedback for physical therapy or exercise. If you move your arm in natural gestures, the electro-luminescent lights sparkle like sequins with every movement. When you bend your arm for exercise, as in a weight-lifting bicep curl, the sleeve counts repetitions, encouraging body awareness. A variable resistor in the sleeve senses body position, while an on-board microprocessor facilitates interaction through electro-luminescence and sound. Therapy can also be coupled with expression, communication, performance, play, jewelry, and tools. This playful exploration could also be used to teach people how to protect their ligaments and muscles from strain and injury while playing tennis, squash, or golf, or even picking up their small children.",

The interferometer consists of surface-micromachined interdigital fingers that are alternately attached to a proof mass and support substrate. Illuminating the fingers with coherent light generates a series of diffracted optical beams. Sub-angstrom displacements between the proof mass and frame are detected by measuring the intensity of a diffracted beam. The structure is fabricated with a two-mask silicon process and detected with a standard laser diode and photodetector. We estimate that the minimum detectable acceleration is six orders of magnitude below the acceleration of gravity (i.e., 2 ug/rootHz in a 1 Hz bandwidth centered at 650 Hz).

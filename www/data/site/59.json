Elaborating on the growing problem of pollution, we designed a concept around the evolution of people to be able to filter the air and create a shelter around themselves, emphasising the importance of connection/togetherness.

We were inspired by the greek philosopher Aristofanes (read below) and ended up designing a wearable wing that could clean the air.",

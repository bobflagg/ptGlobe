        "content": "Natural interactions with spatially aware devices.  Despite how well virtually connected our devices are (iCloud, Dropbox, \u2026), they still lack a tangible connection. A (representation of a) physical connection of those devices would facilitate a more intuitive interaction built on traditional mental models from the physical world. That\u2019s one of the main reasons why kids interact with iPad so naturally, because it uses interfaces based on natural, tangible interactions.",

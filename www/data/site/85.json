The SEC is an extension to the free open-source program EyesWeb\u00a0that contains a large number of machine learning and signal processing algorithms that have been specifically designed for real-time pattern and gesture recognition.  All the algorithms within the SEC are encapsulated as individual blocks, allowing the user to connect the output of one block to the input of another to create a signal flow chain.  This allows a user to quickly build and train their own custom gesture recognition syst",

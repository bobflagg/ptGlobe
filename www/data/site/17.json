Why do we start games with the most boring part, reading directions? How can we create a product that does not create an abundance of work for parents? Key insights generated from field work, interviews, and measurement of electrodermal activity are: kids become bored listening to directions, \"it's like going to school\"; parents feel rushed reading directions as they sense their children's boredom; children and parents",

Physiological arousal is an important part of occupational therapy for children with autism and ADHD, but therapists do not have a way to objectively measure how therapy affects arousal. We hypothesize that when children participate in guided activities within an occupational therapy setting, informative changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) can be detected using iCalm. iCalm is a small, wireless sensor that measures EDA and motion, worn on the wrist or above the ankle.

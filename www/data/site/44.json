Remembering these causal execution traces allows parallel threads to reflect, recognize, and react to the history and status of other threads. Novel forms of complex, adaptive, nonlinear control algorithms can be written in the Funk2 programming language. Currently, Funk2 is implemented to take advantage of distributed grid processors consisting of a heterogeneous network of computers, so that hundre",

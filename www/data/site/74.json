AirSketcher, a novel electric fan that enables the user to directly control the directions and paths in which wind is blown, is presented. AirSketcher is a robotic fan with two servomotors to control its orientation and an embedded camera. We introduce three techniques that allow the user to control and design wind direction and path: 1) AirWand: Drawing the wind path by moving visual markers through the air in front of the fan, 2) AirCanvas: Drawing the wind path on a tablet display that shows ",

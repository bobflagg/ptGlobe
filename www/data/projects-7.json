The sequence of activities in the room was recorded by the camera. The room was then emptied, leaving only dots from the mirror grid alignment. The projector (playing the footage captured by the camera) was placed on a platform rotating at the same rate as the original film camera. The images of the audience appeared and disappeared as the mirror wall was built and unbuilt, projected onto the walls of the same room. Carousel uses this same visual technique to create a communication link between two public spaces. The center of each room will have a rotating podium. A camera, microphone, speakers, and a projector sit on each podium. The podiums rotate slowly at the same rate. As they rotate, the images captured as the camera rotates in one room are projected around the space in the other room and vice versa. The result is a moving snapshot-in-time along the periphery of the room as people, both physically present and projected, are moving about the space.",

The Perifoveal Display takes this abstraction from the user and visualizes it in a way that the full range of vision can be used for data monitoring. This can be realized by taking care of the different visual systems in our eye. Our vision has a field of view from about 120\u00b0, which is highly sensitive for motion. 6\u00b0 of our vision is very slow but complex enough to read text.",

The Media Matrix was presented as an interactive poster at CHI 2001 in Seattle, WA. The next stage in this project involves converting over to battery power, eliminating the need of the powered shelf system. Each unit will consume under a microamp in sleep mode. A special coded \"flashlight\" can be beamed at any unit, causing it to wake up and read the ID sent in the optical beam.

In this case, an ordinary plush toy chicken, augmented with wireless sensing technology, may provide a more iconic and natural interface. In this project we are exploring novel interfaces that allow users to direct the behavior of interactive animated characters who have minds of their own. We are particularly interested in exploring how the innate intelligence of the characters can be used to facilitate the interpretation of the user's actions. Drawing on experience in mechanical and electrical engineering, gesture recognition, visual arts, sculpture, and animation, our group designs new toys to match our interactive worlds. In Swamped! we demonstrate the use of a wireless, plush-toy chicken to direct the actions of an animated chicken.",

The activeShelves can display simple text and graphics on LED displays. Based on our work with TouchCounters, activeShelves continues the exploration of enhancing typical organizational systems. The new system senses using RFID tags instead of mechanical magnetic contacts.

To interconnect two appliances, the user puts a pin associated with an output appliance such as a lamp or a robot cleaner into an input module such as a",

Unity Authentication (UniAuth) is a way that will provide the students, researchers, faculty and other members of an education institute (like Schools, University, College, etc.) access to general information data (like, Name, School, etc.) of the members of that particular institute by implementing one simple & safe login through UniAuth Application Programming Interface (API). This will make the job easy for the members if they are (for example) developing an application or project and want to test it first on with the members of the University. Another example can be, that if an University is hosting a fest or something like that, then it can create a page just for the members of that University, and then can provide important announcements on that page. The page can make use of UniAuth for the login. The members don't need to sign-up. The data will be collected from the institute. This will make job easier for the members to login. The users (or developers) don\u2019t get direct access to UniAuth NoSQL database to get the results. The developers have to use UniAuth API, which will perform all checks before giving back any result. The engine of UniAuth logs every request that is sent by any developer. Every member password is stored in encrypted form. UniAuth server runs totally different from the institute's main server. Even in the worst case, there will be no loss or harm, or anything to the Main Server, as UniAuth uses the API method to do all it\u2019s operations. UniAuth, in simple, works by receiving a HTTP request from the developer, the UniAuth engine process the request, and returns results in JSON format. If any errors, then it give response with HTTP errors. Password will be randomly generated 5 digit number. The username will be created by an automatic process of removing the spaces from the full name. For example, MohitDhanjani If the username is already taken, then a format of (First Name)+(1st letter of Fathers name)+(Last name) will be used. And removing any spaces from the username. Example, \u2018Mohit Ramesh Dhanjani\u2019 will become \u2018MohitRDhanjani\u2019. If that too is taken. Then the format of (FullName)++ will be used. Example, MohitDhanjani1. For the implementation of UniAuth, certain phases need to be followed as listed below... 1. Developing the API. 2. Importing current data from institute's Main Server to UniAuth Server. 3. Username creation. 4. Password creation. 5. Connecting the institute's Main Server to UniAuth for inserting future entries (Connection through API only). 6.

        "content": "Polarization Fields: Glasses-Free 3DTV. We introduce polarization field displays as an optically efficient design for dynamic light field display using multi-layered LCDs. Such displays consist of a stacked set of liquid crystal panels with a single pair of crossed linear polarizers. Each layer is modeled as a spatially controllable polarization rotator, as opposed to a conventional spatial light modulator that directly attenuates light. We demonstrate that such displays can be controlled, at interactive refresh rates, by adopting the SART algorithm to tomographically solve for the optimal spatially varying polarization state rotations applied by each layer. We validate our design by constructing a prototype using modified off- the-shelf panels. We demonstrate interactive display using a GPU-based SART implementation supporting both polarization-based and attenuation-based architectures.",

        "content": "Responsive Tagging Based on Optically Triggered Microprocessor Wakeup. A prime goal of ubiquitous computing is the embedding of sensing, communication, and computation into everyday objects. One consequence of this paradigm is that perhaps nothing will be lost again, allowing us to gain rapid access to the objects we want. This is particularly important in the age of digital storage media, where information content is often not obviously expressed by the appearance of packaging. The mechanical constraints of CDs, DVDs, and MiniDVs, for example, means that their content is abstracted into or scrawled onto anonymous, homogeneous containers. This is even true of books. How many times have we stared at a shelf full of books in the library only to find what we are looking for half an hour later? We have designed an active tagging system that responds to a coded optical beam from several meters away. The tags contain a minimalist microprocessor that ambiently operates in shutdown mode and, upon detecting particular frequency components in the AM-modulated interrogation beam, awakens to decode the incident digital message and produce an appropriate response. The lack of linear amplifiers means that these tags draw under 0.5 \u00b5A when sleeping, hence can operate up to 10 years on a lithium coin cell. The interrogator is a \u201cflashlight,\u2014 with which one scans an area; when the light beam hits a tag programmed with a code that matches that sent by the interrogator, an on-tag LED flashes, indicating that the desired object is \u201cfound.\"",

Our new display uses measurements of refractive errors (see also NETRA) and cataract maps (see also CATRA) to free the viewer from needing wearable optical corrections when looking at displays. It supports nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, presbyopia (reading glasses), coma, keratoconus, other higher-order aberrations and any type of cataracts. We introduce tailored displays that enhance visual acuity by decomposing virtual objects and placing the resulting anisotropic pieces into the subject's focal range. Our tailoring process uses aberration and scattering maps to account for refractive errors and cataracts. It splits an object's light field into multiple instances that are each in-focus for a given eye subaperture. Their integration onto the retina leads to a quality improvement of perceived images when observing the display with naked eyes. The use of multiple depths to render each point of focus on the retina creates multi-focus, multi-depth displays. User evaluations and validation with modified camera optics are performed. The new display is ideal for daily tasks where using eyeglasses are unfeasible or inconvenient (e.g., on head-mounted displays, e-readers, as well as for games); when a multi-focus function is required but undoable (e.g., driving for farsighted individuals, checking a portable device while doing physical activities for presbyopic); or for correcting the visual distortions produced by high-order aberrations that mere eyeglasses are not able to.",

As the perturbations scan downward, illuminating LEDs are pulse-width modulated to scan out a 3-D image. The fountain will employ the use of new UV LEDs and phosphorescent dye to create as bright an image as possible. A show-control software system is also being developed that would enable the images in the fountain to be linked with audio and other content.",

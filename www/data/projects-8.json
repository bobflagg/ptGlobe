We have designed an interface to measure bowing parameters produced by real players, while maintaining the portability and playability of a traditional violin bow. This interface, the Hyperbow, consists of a carbon-fiber violin bow with a custom wireless sensing system (with accelerometers, gyroscopes, electric field position and force sensors). The Hyperbow is partnered with a Yamaha Silent Violin SV-200 also augmented with gesture sensors. This playable measurement system is the core component of an experimental setup used to investigate the bowing parameters produced by real violinists. In these investigations, the parameters are recorded with the sound produced during performances of different bowing techniques (d\u00e9tach\u00e9, martel\u00e9, spiccato). These data can then be analyzed to help understand the various strategies employed by violinists to achieve similar goals in sound production.",

Hand Gesture Recognition a highly anticipated technology of this century ,has different face towards our environment.We developed gesture interface device which eliminates the use mouse and the keyboard from our traditional computers . In this system a webcam is used to track the objects and a computer vision algorithm is used to control the devices based on the webcam input.It can be stretched to any of our daily applications,such as Television,Gaming..etc The traditional user interfaces relies much on the mouse and keyboard. But it is difficult to use these devices continuously. The aim is to develop a gesture based interface, where the system uses inbuilt webcam to track the hand movement and controls the mouse pointer accordingly. The first step towards this is the development of object tracking mechanism. Though there several object tracking algorithms are readily available, CAMSHIFT algorithm provides more accuracy when compared to MEAN SHIFT and others. The other option is the use of HAAR classifiers but involves a tedious process of training and also we cannot extend it to different objects. So we modified the OpenCv CAMSHIFT algorithm to track our objects. The Second Step is to distinguish the object color from our skin color, so we added a red ribbon to the hands such it not only provides a clear view but also gives an option for different gestures. Finally the algorithm tracks the hand using the input from the webcam and the co-ordinates are extracted from the tracked object for every frame and passed to windows m functions. Thus whenever the object is moved via webcam, the cursor also moves accordingly. Different gestures are used to produce click functions and other operations.",

It allows each wheel to be independently controlled both in power and direction (a full 360 degrees). This configuration and control mechanism allows for virtually any possible movement which can be made by a wheeled vehicle. While more complicated compared to most other control mechanisms it is the least restrictive and could be employed in specialized robots where operational requirements change. Many of the standard wheeled drive configurations that are used in vehicles and robotics are chosen because of their simplicity to build, control, and suitability to a specific task (kinds of mobility / maneuverability required). This generally works well except each of these common configurations typically exclude maneuvers that another form might have, thus having the designers to make a limiting choice (what can they live without). This was the motivating thought, can we design a steering system that is reasonably reliably, cost effective, replaceable, and most important uncompromising in functionality. Essential this would be an extension of synchronous steering, with the main difference being that in a synchronous configuration all wheels are able to rotate orientation to 90 degrees as long as all the wheels are rotated to the same angle. In our configuration we stipulate that each wheel can rotate its orientation a full 360 degrees and drive power independently of one another. Review of many different drive mechanisms to see what each specifically offered, how they were different, the complexity in building the mechanism, the electronic control of the mechanics, and how to interface with the controls. We looked at differential, skid, ackermann, synchronous, omni, articulated, and independent. <p>The list of parts included in this design is: <br /> <ul> <li>Drive Motors: CIMS - 1 per wheel - there are (4) wheels</li> <li>Wheels: 4 in AndyMark Plaction wheels (am-0198)</li> <li>Gear Reduction: 8.30:1 in 2 stages (56:18 by HTD5 synchronous belt & pulleys; 24:9 by #35 chain & sprockets)</li> <li>Steering Motors: BaneBots M3-RS395-12 - 1 per wheel</li> <li>Steering Reduction: BaneBots 3-stage 132:1 planetary gearbox; transmitted 1:1 via HTD5 synchronous belt with 32T pulleys</li> </ul> </p> This design was further modified to make it more cost effective to implement this in an actual robot, and make each wheel component self contained within a cube that can be easily swapped out when problems arose. We also learned that in the actual implementation the sway / lateral movement of the wheel mechanism when under stress was not stable so we needed a way to stabilize the lateral movement. The implementation proved to be a very cost effective and agile first iteration of the concept. More improvements can be made on how the lateral force of the drive mechanism is handled and replacing nylon buffers with bearings for a stronger and smoother operation. This configuration was able to replicate all the common modes of operation while allowing non-standard ways of movement. We decided to go with three wheels instead of 4 to save on weight in the overall design. However controlling this type of locomotion is not trivial, both in the logic implementation and physical control. Better input devices are required besides the dual joystick configuration we used. Encoders were used to track the wheel position as well as speed of rotation paired with a 2-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. These sensors were needed to auto correct for drift and orientation since forward is the way the wheels are pointed (NOT the front of the robot). This notion means the controls translate in real-time relative to the direction of travel, and it was this configuration operators were able to most easily able to control the robot.",

We exploit a combination of two novel ideas which simplify the constraints of traditional devices, with simplified optics and cleaver illumination in order to capture and visualize images of the retina in a standalone device easily operated by the user.

This is a meta-project of the projects to be showcased at the Annual Wearable Computing Fashion Show to be held in Silicon Valley, CA, USA, in August 2013. The current organizing group is composed of Jessica Lam, Li Bian, and Star Simpson For centuries, women have been at the margins of economic value and influence in society. In Silicon Valley, the majority of companies on every scale\u2014from startups to the Forbes list, are headed by men. Two female MIT alums are about to turn this into a supportive environment for women to turn Silicon Valley into a much bigger and better major think tank and innovative society. Two women, Li Bian, founder and CEO of Truonex, a leading technology start-up aiming to analyze and synthesize research data, and Jessica Lam, a PhD candidate in Physical Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Oxford, first met freshmen year at MIT and are now both head of their own startup-companies and paving pathways for other women to make advances. With their creativity and knowledge cultivated from years of tooling at MIT, they are now banning together to create an unprecedented annual high-end technology fashion show, called [*******]. [*******] will merge ideas from incongruous fields to create a continuum of science, art, problem solving, engineering, design. [*******] will promote a new kind of solidarity, stemming from teamwork between both scientists and fashion designers, who must work together out of their comfort zone. The proceeds from this event will be used to further promote the empowerment of women but from a very different background. They will be used to build an endowment to bring, for the first time, women from Afghanistan to do their full undergraduate degrees at the University of Oxford, through Jessica\u2019s charitable company, One Woman a Year International (OWAY). In later years, the proceeds will help OWAY expand its support to women from other countries, such as Pakistan, Somalia, and North Korea, and fund their undergraduate degrees at a wonder range of leading universities, such as MIT, Harvard, and Yale. Nikolas Kristof from the NY Times and Washington Post, and winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, wrote that to solve major world problems, such as global poverty, terrorism, and maternal mortality, communities must \u201cstrive to build broad coalitions across liberal and conservative lines. This makes practical results far easier to achieve.\u201d **********ONE MORE SENTENCE *************.

Inspired by the Danish fairy tale The Emperor's New Clothes and Lady Gaga's Orbit dress, we designed and implemented a costume, The Queen's New Clothes, which appears plain to naked eyes but exhibits changing patterns on photos taken at different time and location. The process of making this costume has taken us on a journey of exploring the digital aspect and dual status of fashion, fashion as a dynamically changing and embodied visual communication tool. The art of projection has been explored and applied in diverse fields, ranging from motion graphics and stage design to city graffiti. In motion graphics and stage design, the artists often try to synchronize the dancers\u2019 motion with projection seamlessly to create surreal effects or add additional digital information onto the physical human body. Academic researchers have also discovered ways for people to prevent their photos being taken by projecting flash back at the photographers. Julius Von Bismarck, a student at the University of the Arts in Berlin, utilizes similar technique to project graffiti onto the surroundings, such as the Magritte dove onto Mao Zedong\u2019s Portrait in Tiananmen Square, a cross onto Obama\u2019s podium while he was delivering a speech in Berlin in 2008, and watermarks onto street advertisement boards. Thus, we can see that the art of projection involves playing with the visibility\u2014or invisibility\u2014of the projected image to naked eyes at particular timing. Such invisibility reminded us of the Danish tale, the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes, where the emperor claimed to have clothes on but everyone in the parade was seeing him naked. We wondered: can we help the emperor with modern technology if he were parading in our time? In quest for a solution, one of the fashion icon in today\u2019s pop culture, Lady Gaga, caught our attention with her Grammy Awards Orbit dress. Inspired by the orbital structure, we designed and implemented Queen\u2019s New Clothes, a wearable computing, fashion design piece which appears plain to naked eyes but displays changing patterns on the photos taken. Our initial design resembled the rotating orbits that Lady Gaga wore, as in Figure 1. After more in-depth consideration and experiment, we finalized on a design of three interwoven, nonratable orbits, so that it is easier to mount the projectors and sensor circuit for more accurate pattern display. Figure 2 shows our current design on a manikin, with a photo resistor in the neck position connected to the sensor circuit attached on the lower back of the body, and three projectors custom made for the design. Each projector is consisted of a wooden box made through laser-cutting machine. The choice of wooden material, instead of plastics, prevents light leaking and increases the brightness of projected image. Each wooden box contains film and a lens, placed apart at focal length distance. The Queen's New Clothes uses a PIC microcontroller to trigger active illumination sources behind patterned film placed at the conjugate plane to the subject's body behind a small lens. When an external camera flash is detected by a phototransistor common emitter amplifier circuit, the active illumination is triggered. The illumination sources used are flash tubes from Kodak disposable flash cameras. The cameras are disassembled, and a 12A, 400V, silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) is placed across the flash unit's trigger terminals. The extreme specifications of the SCR are necessary to withstand the high current and voltage of the flash tube trigger pulse, which is triggered by the physical action of the shutter in Kodak's design. The flash units are packaged in wooden laser-cut press-fit boxes to prevent electric shock. In our design, up to eleven flash units can be triggered in sequence by a single microcontroller and phototransistor to accommodate pre-flashes in various camera designs, and the relatively long charge time of the disposable flash units. The system can be powered from a bench-top power supply for display in an installation, or AA batteries for portable use with limited exposures. Figure 3, 4, and 5 shows different patterns on the manikin captured through an SLR camera with flash.",

This research examines aspects of the creative process such iteration and comparison, two key strategies for discovering contextual design variables and their interrelationships. We found that, even under tight time constraints when the common intuition is to stop iterating and start refining, iterative prototyping helps designers learn. What's our approach? We recruit people to participate in tasks where the solutions are creatively diverse and objectively measurable. We've had success using the egg drop design task where participants create a vessel to protect a raw egg. Most recently, our studies call on participants to create Web banner ads. We then place the ads in an online campaign, collect a host of analytics (e.g., click-through data), and statistically compare performance differences.

For example, change in gait over extended time is used in neurological exams to diagnose dementias. Changes in gait over short periods of time may be indicative of a number of conditions, such as the onset of a stroke and progression of congestive heart failure. Continuous monitoring of gait could be useful for physical therapy and rehabilitation. For instance, patients who have undergone knee replacement therapy are advised to place less weight on the corresponding foot; feedback when excessive weight is applied could help prevent re-injury. Gait feedback could also be used for athletic analysis, both to provide complex gait information to elite athletes and to provide real-time exercise feedback and incentives to everyday athletes. Precise gait analysis is currently done in a motion lab; however, these large labs are expensive to maintain and costly to use. We are developing a wireless wearable system that is capable of making many inexpensive measurements. These measurements may have less precision, but may provide more information by collecting data throughout the day in the patient's home environment. Our system will be optimized for gait analysis and for detecting medically relevant gait characteristics.",

Current work suggests that preferences are initially malleable, but become \"imprinted\" (precisely defined and largely invariant) after the individual makes an initial decision. Prior to imprinting, preferences are \"arbitrary,\" (highly responsive both to normative and non-normative influences).

Current 3-D laser scanning systems require a lengthy interval to complete each scan and require a clear line-of-sight, thereby severing the physical model from its CAD representation, and not allowing most handheld interaction because of occlusion. This project proposes 3-D volumetric sensing using real-time tag tracking that allows the user to manipulate the physical model object while the tags are being scanned. This approach provides a seamless link between the real object and the virtual object, effectively converging the design and modeling processes for artists, architects, and engineers. The tag detection scheme uses magnetically coupled resonators similar to those developed for the Swept RF Tagging project. The current areas of investigation include reducing the dimensions of the tags, improving the signal-to-noise ratio of location measurement of tags in each axis, and increasing the number of trackable tags to form meaningful shapes and contours.

Gestures [Natasha Sinha and Hugo Sol\u00eds] is composed for six Music Shapers, two trumpets, two trombones, two violas, and one double bass. In this piece, the children use the Shapers to improvise and create audio gestures in response to the sound environment produced by the acoustic instruments. The Shaper's sounds are in turn derived from the acoustic. Gestures is a celebration of collaborative improvisation that conveys excitement, uncertainty and joy, and takes players and listeners on a journey to discover the complex yet simple roots of creativity. The compositional process of Gestures was itself quite unusual in at least two ways. First, the piece is the result of close collaboration between a graduate student specialized in electronic music composition and a 12-year-old composer. Second, the process and techniques involved in its creation were diverse and enjoyable, designed to encourage both creators to think in new ways. Drawing, singing, improvising and formalizing audio gestures were some of the methods employed to build the score. In fact, the unique experiences of two composers from different backgrounds, working and learning from each other, served as a basis for imagining the piece itself. Shared interests were passion to explore non-traditional techniques for the acoustical instruments, the desire to make Shapers an idiomatic instrument, the use of space as compositional element, and ultimately the desire to create an acoustic frame where freedom was the fundamental spirit for composers, musicians, young participants, and audience alike.",

Humanoid bipeds are rapidly becoming a more common part of our everyday life. Therefore, they must also be able to navigate our environments adroitly if they are to assist us in our daily living. This project takes biomechanical principals of angular momentum and applies them to design of controllers for bipeds using angular momentum primitives. These primitives are basic units that simplify the control problem and reduce the dimensionality of the state-space and the objective task. The task in this project is to accomplish transient behaviors and steady state walking together. Through this we are able to realize a more efficient and effective control for humanoid robots.",

We demonstrate that such displays can be controlled, at interactive refresh rates, by adopting the SART algorithm to tomographically solve for the optimal spatially varying polarization state rotations applied by each layer. We validate our design by constructing a prototype using modified off- the-shelf panels.

Then, an expectation propagation algorithm is proposed to address the inference problem. As an extension of belief propagation, expectation propagation efficiently approximates a Bayesian estimation by iteratively propagating information between different nodes in the dynamic system and projecting exact messages into the exponential family. Compared to sequential Monte Carlo filters and smoothers, the new method has much lower computational complexity since it makes analytically deterministic approximations instead of Monte Carlo approximations. Our simulations demonstrate that the new receiver achieves accurate detection without the aid of any training symbols or decision feedbacks. Future work involves joint decoding and channel estimation, where convolutional codes are used to protect signals from noise corruption. Initial results are promising.",

We have compared strategies of learning from worked-out examples vs. learning by being tutored. We also studied how differences in prior knowledge affect learning by comparing learning outcomes from \u201cgood\u201d SimStudent, who has stronger prior knowledge of prerequisite concepts, and \u201cpoor\u201d SimStudent, who has weaker, more perceptually-oriented prior knowledge. The purpose of this project is to study how students fail to learn correct knowledge components when studying from examples and make (typical) errors by applying such incorrect knowledge components later when solving problems. We utilize a computational model of learning, called SimStudent that learns cognitive skills inductively from examples either by passively reviewing worked-out examples or by actively engaged in tutored problem-solving. We are particularly interested in studying how the differences in prior knowledge affect the nature and rate of learning. We hypothesize that when students rely on shallow, domain general features (which we call \"weak\" features) as opposed to deep, more domain specific features (\"strong\" features), then students would more likely to make induction errors. To test this hypothesis, we control SimStudent's prior knowledge to study how and when erroneous skills are learned by analyze learning outcomes (both the process of learning and the performance on the post-test). Figure 1 shows average step score, aggregated across the test problems and student conditions. The X-axis shows the number of training iterations. The Weak-PK and Strong-PK conditions had similar success rates on test problems after the first 8 training problems. After that, the performance of the two conditions began to diverge. On the final test after 20 training problems, the Strong-PK condition was 82% correct while the Weak-PK was 66%, a large and statistically significant difference (t = 4.00, p < .001). http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Application_of_SimStudent_for_Error_Analysis Figure 2 shows a number of true negative predictions made on the test problems for each of the training iterations. Surprisingly, the Weak PK condition did make as many as 22 human-like errors on the 11 test problems. On the other hand, the Strong PK condition hardly made human-like errors. A simple fit to power law functions to the learning curves (converting success rate to log-odds) showed that the slope (or rate) of the Weak-PK learning curve (.78) is smaller (or slower) than that of the Strong-PK learning curve (.82).

Each package, which costs about $40, is powered by a single lithium battery, and can be installed in a few minutes without tearing up the road. The central station uses the sensor data to compute queue-length and departure-rate statistics for each road segment, and uses Little's Formula to assign a time in seconds to each road link. This database is published once a minute on the Internet. Vehicles will use CDPD or a similar wireless network standard to download the relevant sections of the database, and plan optimum (shortest-time or least-fuel) routes through the road network, informing the driver of suggested route changes in real time.

The human ankle provides a significant amount of net positive work during the stance period of walking, especially at moderate to fast walking speeds. Conversely, conventional ankle-foot prostheses are completely passive during stance, and consequently, cannot provide net positive work. Clinical studies indicate that transtibial amputees using conventional prostheses experience many problems during locomotion, including a high gait metabolism, a low gait speed, and gait asymmetry. Researchers believe the main cause for the observed locomotion is due to the inability of conventional prostheses to provide net positive work during stance. The objective of this project is to develop a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that is capable of providing net positive work during the stance period of walking. To this end, we are investigating the mechanical design and control system architectures for the prosthesis. We also conduct a clinical evaluation of the proposed prosthesis on different amputee participants.",

To address these issues, electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the PhysioNet Online Database will be analyzed using new spectrum estimation techniques to develop a program able to predict, as well as recognize, the onset of specific cardiac arrhythmias such as PAF.
